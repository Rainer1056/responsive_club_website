# responsive_club_website
This is a project done for Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Career Path.

The challenge was to use every single responsive design technique learned so far in order to create a robust webpage.

The features I included in this website:
- Media Queries that ensured the website stayed coherent regardless of viewport size.
- Flexbox (implemented correctly this time); used to create an image gallery that maintains it format regardless of viewport size.
- Using responsive units like Rem, %, and properties like min-height, and max-height.
- Buttons in the navigation/header section with a hover animation made with "@keyframes" in CSS.
